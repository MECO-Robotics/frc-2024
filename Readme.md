# MECO Robotics FRC Team 8324 Delta-V Robot

Delta-V is our 2024 Competition Robot. Delta-V (pronounced delta vee) is a general physics term for change in velocity, which is acceleration, but also has a more [specific meaning in rockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta-v). And if you know anything about MECO, it's we're all about rockets and space!
